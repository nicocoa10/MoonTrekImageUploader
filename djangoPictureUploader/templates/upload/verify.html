    <p> <b>If youre in this page in means the picture was succesfully uploaded to our Database , now we need to verify a few things</b> </p>

    <p> The goal of this page is to verify with the user the image they uploaded </p>
    <p> If a user submitted a picture with gps data we will ask them if thats the correct location and time</p>
    <p> If a user submitted a picture with no gps location or exif data we will ask them for it in the page</p>
    <p> I guess once we get this confirmation we should save it in DB?</p>
